# Ruby Exercises and Terminology

[Link to exercises](https://github.com/cruzgerman216/CodeLabs-Ruby-on-Rails-Exercises) <br>
Here is a list of ruby terms and definitions used in class.

## Part 1

<em>**Layer of Abstraction**</em> - Layering code in by type and timing of functionality<br>
<em>**Data Type**</em> - The classification of data (i.e. string, number, boolean, array) <br>
<em>**Variable**</em> - Holds a value in a word or letter that can be changed <br>
<em>**What's the difference between a local variable, constant variable, and a global variable?**</em> - Local variables can only be accessed in local scope. Global variables are definied in the global scope, and can be accessed throughout the program. Constant variables hold a value that should not be changed during the execution of the program. <br>
<em>**What does scope mean?**</em> - The section of the program where a given variable can be used <br>
<em>**Constant Variable**</em> - Variables that cannot be changed during the execution of a program <br>
<em>**Method**</em> - A programmed formula that can be ran when called in scope <br>
<em>**IRB**</em> - Interactive Ruby, an REPL that allows the user to execute ruby commands in realtime <br>
<em>**Operators**</em> - Evaluate mathmatical expressions. I.e. + - \* / <br>
<em>**Class**</em> - A blueprint from which individual objects are created <br>
<em>**Gem**</em> - Open source libraries that contain Ruby code <br>

## Part 2

## Part 2

<em>**Conditional**</em> - Statement that executes code depending on whether a condition is true or false <br>
<em>**The difference between if, elseif and else.**</em> When "if" is true, the code between "if" and "end" will run. When "if" is not true, and the "elseif" statement is true, the code that between "elseIf" and "end" will run. When neither of these conditions are met, the "else" code runs <br>
<em>**What are Case/When statements? </em> - Conditional statements similar to if/else statements. Case statements apply only when each case is true.<br>
<em>**What is a data structure? </em> - Data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification <rb>
<em>**Arrays**</em> - List of items (strings, integers, arrays, objects, etc) <br>
<em>**What is meant by 'built-in' methods?**</em> - Methods that have already been definied in the programming language <br>
<em>**Loops**</em> - Allow a code block to be repeated as long as a condition is met <br>
<em>**What are infinite loops?**</em> - A loop that has a condition that is always met, and runs the looped code indefinitely<br>

## Part 3

<em>**What is Object Oriented Programming?**</em> - A programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications <br>
<em>**Class inheritance**</em> - Class inherits all the traits and behaviors of another class <br>
<em>**What are getters and setters?**</em> - Getter: returns the value of the attribute. Setter: sets the value of the attribute.<br>
<em>**Difference between class variables and instance variables and class attributes?**</em> - Class variables are available through every instance of the class. Instance variables are only available on the individual instance. Attributes are specific properties of an object.<br>
<em>**What does self signify in a class?**</em> - Creates an instance of the class <br>
<em>\*\*Modules</em> - Used to bundle commonly used methods for classes <br>

## Part 4

<em>**Bundler**<em> - Used to install Ruby Gems <br>
<em>**Gemfile**<em> - Used to describe gem dependencies <br>
<em>**Bcrypt**<em> - Gem used for detailed encryption <br>
